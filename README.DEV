To compile crlibm after a cvs checkout, type

./prepare
make

or, if you want to perform accuracy tests against the MPFR library,

./prepare --enable-mpfr --with-gmp=/usr/local
make

(if necessary replace /usr/local/ with the actual location of the MPFR
source)

The prepare script requires to be invoked only once. After that, use:
./configure 

The prepare script ends with a call to ./configure, and the options to
prepare are the options of configure. For a list of these options, type
 
./configure --help
